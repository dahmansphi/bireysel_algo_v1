# About the Package
## Author's Words
    Welcome to the First Edition of the Bireysel Algorithm official documentation. I am Dr. Deniz Dahman the creator of the Bireysel algorithm and the author of this package. 

    In the following section you will have a brief introduction on the principal idea of the Bireysel algorithm.  

    In addition, a reference to the academic publication on the method. Before going ahead, I would like to let you know
     that I have done this work as an independent scientist without any fund or similar capacity. 
     I am dedicated to proceeding and seek further improvement of the proposed method at all costs. 
     To this end if you wish to contribute in any way to this work, please find further details 
     in the contributing section.

# Future release 


# --- Library setup -----------------------------------------------------------

# When importing from the root of the unpacked tarball or git checkout,
# Python sees the "h5py" source directory and tries to load it, which fails.
# We tried working around this by using "package_dir" but that breaks Cython.
